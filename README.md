## Scala Overview
### What is Scala?
Scala, short for Scalable Language, is a hybrid functional programming language. It was created by Martin Odersky and it was first released in 2003. Scala Programming language has the ability to grow with the growth in the technicalities of ones program. Scala smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages and Scala is compiled to run on the Java Virtual Machine.
### History of Scala
Martin Odersky began the initial designing of Scala in the year 2001 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). Before the development of Scala, Odersky has had an experience of working on Sun’s Java compiler, and Generic Java and javac. The language was first released internally in the year 2003. This was accompanied by the first public release of Scala in the beginning of 2004. The language was formally released on the platforms of Java, and .NET in the month of June 2004. With some better features, the 2.0 version of the language was released in March 2006. The developments in the language led towards the formal cessation of the .Net support in the year 2012.
### Where is Scala used?
Many existing companies, who depend on Java for business critical applications, are turning to Scala to boost their development productivity, applications scalability and overall reliability. A wide range of companies, such as LinkedIn, Intel, or Twitter are using Scala. Scala language consists of a very robust static system provides farfetched support for functional programming. The language is designed in a manner that makes it concise yet function. 
### Intresting and Importnant features of Scala 

* Scala is **object-oriented**:
Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits.Classes are extended by **subclassing** and a flexible **mixin-based composition** mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.
* Scala is **functional**:
Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value and because every value is an object so ultimately every function is an object.
* Scala is **statically** typed:
Scala, unlike some of the other statically typed languages, does not expect you to provide redundant type information. Scala doesn't require the user to specify a type in most cases, and the user doesn't have to repeat it.
* Scala runs on the **JVM**:
Scala is compiled into Java Byte Code, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Scala and Java have a common run-time platform. You can easily move from Java to Scala.
